## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media querys

### What I learned

I could practice with this the centering of components, I use flexbox and margin 0 auto a couple of times. Also I learned more about hsl colors, I wasn't very familiar with that. But I found it entertaining and had a lot of fun I can't wait to resolve more challenges!
